# Humans of Pandemic

## Objectives

Humans of the Pandemic is a community focused project based around
the commonality of our experiences during this crisis. Isolation and disconnection are
just as much of a threat as COVID-19. What we want to do is bring humanity back
together in every way possible. By taking user submitted stories and linking them
together, we create a tapestry of experiences to draw on. Each story will give a look into
the day to day life of someone affected by the pandemic and something they have done
to cope and overcome their isolation. Maybe itâ€™s their favorite sourdough recipe or the
struggles they have had learning a new instrument. We are looking to show that even in
isolation, we can still have human connection and triumph.
