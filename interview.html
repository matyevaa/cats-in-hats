					<p class="question">Q: What do you suggest for people who are struggling with their mental health during this time due to the pandemic?</p>
					<p><span class="italic">Dr. Dodge:</span> “I recommend that they try to reach out to their friends and family as much as possible. However, if they feel like they need to talk to a professional there are many sources available that they could skype or do a telemedicine visit with a mental health professional. I really encourage this because it is very easy and many will simply bill your insurance for the appointment. That way, they wouldn’t have to leave their house. If they feel that they don’t need to talk to a mental health professional, I really encourage people to maintain their daily schedule and set small goals each day like ‘Today I’m going to make sure I clean off the dining room table’ or ‘Today I’m going to mop the floor’. Setting small, achievable goals will help them feel a sense of accomplishment in their day. It’s really easy to feel overwhelmed and to feel like because we are home, we should be doing everything and our houses should be spotless. We need to give ourselves a little break and set one goal for the day, so we feel accomplished. Trying to follow a healthy diet is also extremely important. Many of us have gotten into a bad diet, and our exercise routines have gone out the window. So, trying to get back on track but also being kind to ourselves and say ‘Today I’m going to eat one healthy meal and go for a walk’. Again, just setting very small, achievable goals so we can pat ourselves on the back and say ‘I set two goals for myself today and I met both of them, I feel good’.”</p>

					<p class="question">Q: In your opinion what is the most effective way people can protect themselves and others from COVID 19?</p>
					<p><span class="italic">Dr. Dodge:</span> “First and foremost, washing your hands is huge! Anytime you touch something and you’re going to eat, wash your hands. It’s much better than hand sanitizer, going back to soap and water is the most effective way. However, hand sanitizer is a close second, so if you don’t have water and soap available, use hand sanitizer before you touch anything that is going to come in contact with your mouth. Also, we often take our masks on and off many times during the day, so we are touching them quite a lot. We need to be really mindful of unhooking them by the ear and putting it down in a clean place and not rubbing our nose in it, just being very mindful of wearing the mask. And then social distancing; it sounds so cliché and we’re all talking about it, but really trying to keep your distance where you’re not within 3 feet of someone casually breathing on you, but the 6 feet rule is really for when someone could cough or sneeze on you, which could happen at any time. So, I think hand washing, mask wearing and being careful with your mask, and staying 6 feet apart as much as possible is critical.”</p>

					<p class="question">Q: What’s one thing that stands out in your mind about the effect that the pandemic has had on your job as a physician and do you think any changes you’ve experienced will carry on after the pandemic?</p>
					<p><span class="italic">Dr. Dodge:</span> “The biggest effect that I’ve experienced has been the addition of telemedicine into my practice. This was brand new with the COVID outbreak. Initially it seemed very overwhelming and I was very nervous, but I quickly learned that this was such a positive benefit for my patients both with mental health issues as well as physical. Many people didn’t want to leave their home and come to the clinic and potentially be exposed. Therefore, from their home they could talk with me. Many patients just had simple questions that might not have warranted a full in-clinic visit. So, being able to just chat with them briefly, answer their questions, and calm their nerves was such a wonderful benefit. Many patients love to just have their doctor answer their questions, and instead of going through a big phone tree, I could do face-to-face visits through telemedicine and really have that personal touch with them. This is something I’m hoping I can continue once COVID is over. I think it’s a great benefit for patients struggling both with mental as well as physical ailments.”</p>
