				<h3>Smart Goals</h3>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Many of us are experiencing a drastic change in our<br/>priorities during the pandemic. Whether you are working or<br/>unemployed, take this opportunity to evaluate how you can<br/>use this time wisely. Creating SMART goals is a great way to<br/>develop a plan and stick with it.</p>

			<p>Many of us have received a stimulus check recently. This is a great opportunity to create <br/>a SMART goal and decide what you want to do with the money. Some possibilities<br/> include: putting money in savings, paying bills, or splitting it up for necessities.</p>
			<p>Eating a healthier diet sounds like a good idea, but what dos it actually mean? Aim for<br/> specific goals such as eliminating soda, or eating five servings of vegetables a day.</p>
			<p>Make sure you can measure your goal. Walking four days a week is a goal you can keep <br/>track of.</p>
			<p>Remember to choose realistic goals so you don't get discouraged. Losing 10 pounds a<br/> week sounds great, but it is an impossible gol that will likely lead to you giving up on<br/> your efforts.</p>
